  **"kanji": "上",**

  **"readings": \[**

    **{**

      **"reading": "うえ",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "upper side, above, top, higher status or layer",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.98,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Directly encodes the core spatial/state meaning of 上 as a noun (‘the upper/top side’), used for location and rank; almost all uses are transparently ‘up/upper’."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "うわ",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "outer, surface, upper layer, additional/extra",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.85,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Used mainly as a prefix (上着, 上辺, 上書き) marking surface, outer or upper layer, or something added ‘on top’; keeps the ‘upper/on’ meaning but specialized to layering and surface."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "かみ",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "upper part, higher side, person/thing of higher rank, upstream",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.9,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Marks the ‘upper’ side of a hierarchy or axis (上流, 上座, 上の句). The link to ‘up’ is spatial (upstream, upper seat) and social (higher status) and is consistently maintained."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "あがる",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "to go up, rise, move to a higher place or state",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.95,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Intransitive motion from lower to higher (physically or abstractly: prices, grades, tension). Semantic core is ‘something itself moves upward’, very close to the base meaning of 上."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "あげる",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "to raise, lift, increase, give (upward to someone)",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.95,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Transitive counterpart of あがる: a subject causes something to go ‘up’ (physically, numerically, socially). The ‘giving’ sense can be seen as offering something ‘upwards’ in a social hierarchy."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "のぼる",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "to climb, ascend, go up (a slope, stairs, to the capital), rise to",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.9,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Focuses on progressive upward movement along a path (mountains, stairs, rivers, going ‘up’ to Tokyo). The directional ‘up’ meaning is stable, both literally and metaphorically."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "のぼせる",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "to become dizzy/flushed, to be carried away, to (cause to) be put up or listed",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.7,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Historically related to ‘cause to go up’; modern meanings are metaphorical (‘heat rises to the head’, emotions rise) or administrative (‘put names up on a list’). The ‘upward’ sense is present but more abstract."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "のぼす",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "to raise to, extend to, bring up (a matter), attribute to",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.75,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Transitive/causative variant of のぼる in more formal registers: ‘raise something up to a level’ (e.g., numbers, topics, causes). The ‘up’ meaning survives mainly in figurative extension."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "のぼり",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "climbing, ascent; upward-bound (train, traffic); streamers/banners",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.85,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Nominalizes the ‘going up’ idea: direction toward the center/capital (上り電車) or upward movement (carp streamers flying up). Still clearly tied to an ‘upward’ trajectory."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "ジョウ",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "upper, high, superior; to go up, to put on; first part",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.9,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Sino-Japanese reading used in compounds (以上, 上級, 向上, 上手〈じょうず〉). Meanings cluster around ‘high/upper/superior’ states and ‘increase, improvement’, faithfully reflecting the core 上 concept."**

    **},**

    **{**

      **"reading": "ショウ",**

      **"meaning\_of\_reading": "upper, first (volume/part); alternative on-yomi in limited compounds",**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_value": 0.5,**

      **"relation\_reading\_meaning\_explanation": "Less common on-yomi appearing in specific lexicalized items (e.g., 上巻〈じょうかん／しょうかん〉). Where it appears, it still means ‘upper/first’, but the reading choice is mostly historical/phonological rather than semantically motivated."**
